You are a new Developer, or you are an old developer but donâ€™t have many resources at your hand. want to test several sites at once, but donâ€™t want to get new servers for every one of them. nginx is your disposal.

Itâ€™s called server blocks in Nginx or you can call Virtual Host, but thatâ€™s an Apache Term for the same thing. the steps we are gonna follow for this all thing are here.

#### **_steps toÂ follow:-_**

1.  buy a new Linux server from your provider, be it digital ocean or vultr.
2.  setup ssh to it (itâ€™s better), no problem if you donâ€™t.
3.  login into your server.
4.  install Nginx and your stack like LEMP (e is for Nginx, read and _engineX_)
5.  create separate documents roots in /var/www
6.  create separate server block files in /etc/nginx/sites-available
7.  create symbolic links to /sites-enabled directory
8.  restart Nginx and test.
9.  Debug.

### Step 1: Buy a Linux Server from Digital Ocean or Vultr (no need if you have oneÂ already)

just buy a VPS or shared Server from Digital Ocean or Vultr or any other Provider (there is no need if you already have one).

### Step 2: Setup SSH (secure shell)Â access

SSH stands for secure shell, itâ€™s better to set it up each time you want to access some remote server from your system, Iâ€™ll write a guide for how to do it, for now, Iâ€™m linking to another article, you can read it if you want to set SSH.Â 

This is a link for Digital Ocean Droplets, you can find for Vultr or other providers, by doing one or two Google searches ðŸ˜ƒ

### Step 3: Log in to yourÂ Server

Depending on your setup either by SSH or HTTPS, you must now login to your server shell
